## software package
### ML predicts protein corona

[ENM-Protein-Predict](https://github.com/BanZhan/RF-and-PC 'RFandPc') Protein will reside in the protein corona on the surface of engineered nanomaterials&#x20;

[RF-and-PC](https://github.com/BanZhan/RF-and-PC)Machine Learning Predicts the Functional Composition of the Protein Corona and the Cellular Recognition of Nanoparticles

[swnt-protein-corona-ML](https://github.com/NicholasOuassil/swnt-protein-corona-ML)Ensemble classifiers and data scraping tools for the prediction of protein surface adsorption to single-walled carbon nanotubes
[UnitedAtom](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-651X/ab3b6e) This tool uses physics-based atomistic simulations to model bio-nano interactions and calculates adsorption
energies and preferred orientations of the proteins on the NP surface. This allows ranking of the different proteins according to their adsorption affinities for specific NPs, and to predict the kinetics of
the protein corona formation
