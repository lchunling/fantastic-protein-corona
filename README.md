## software package
### ML predicts protein corona

[ENM-Protein-Predict](https://github.com/BanZhan/RF-and-PC 'RFandPc') Protein will reside in the protein corona on the surface of engineered nanomaterials&#x20;

[Prediction of protein corona on nanomaterials by machine learning using novel descriptors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S245207482030001X?via%3Dihub)Prediction of protein corona using fluorescein-labeled protein corona as a nanofeature

[RF-and-PC](https://github.com/BanZhan/RF-and-PC)Machine Learning Predicts the Functional Composition of the Protein Corona and the Cellular Recognition of Nanoparticles

[swnt-protein-corona-ML](https://github.com/NicholasOuassil/swnt-protein-corona-ML)Ensemble classifiers and data scraping tools for the prediction of protein surface adsorption to single-walled carbon nanotubes

[UnitedAtom](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-651X/ab3b6e) This tool uses physics-based atomistic simulations to model bio-nano interactions and calculates adsorption
energies and preferred orientations of the proteins on the NP surface. This allows ranking of the different proteins according to their adsorption affinities for specific NPs, and to predict the kinetics of
the protein corona formation

### ML by protein corona analysis

[BSAI](https://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2010.164)Characterizing a biological surface adsorption index describes these interactions by quantifying the competitive adsorption of a set of small molecule probes on nanoparticles.

[Protein Corona Fingerprinting Predicts the Cellular Interaction of Gold and Silver Nanoparticles](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/nn406018q) Predicting biological interactions of nanoparticles by protein corona using quantitative modeling
